            <p className="about__hello">Hey!</p>
            <p>
                I'm Anna, frontend developer with more than 4 years of commercial development experience.
            </p>
            <p>
                I enjoy creating user-friendly, effective and useful things and I always try to find the best way to do it.
                My preferrable stack is VueJS + TypeScript, however, I feel enthusiastic about learning using any new technologies and concepts.
